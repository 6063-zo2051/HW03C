# HOMEWORK 03 PART C

This goal of this assignment is to recreate the Sol LeWitt drawing of random lines.

## SUMMARY

This assignment initially seemed hard to attack. I thought that I would have to create 50 different lines to achieve the look, which would have been extremely tedious. Instead, I created 1 simple for loop and made random point ranges for two coordinate sets. I applied these to a line and chose for my loop to run 150 times.
